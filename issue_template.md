Please make sure you've read http://ensime.github.io/editors/emacs/troubleshooting/

In particular note that there is very little we can do unless you provide us with a minimal reproduction of the problem. Please provide:

1. a standalone project on github (or use ensime-server)
1. step by step instructions to trigger the bug (videos are useful)
1. attach your .ensime to the repository (or in a gist)
1. also attach the output from the ENSIME server buffer
1. also attach an emacs stacktrace (if relevant), e.g. via (setq debug-on-error t)

The next step is for us to help you create a unit test that fails. We’ll give as much help as we can, our goal is to grow this community. You have all the skills you’ll need to make ENSIME even better.
